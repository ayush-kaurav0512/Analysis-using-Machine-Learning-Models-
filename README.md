Dataset used for the this Project are mentioned below:-

# Heart Disease:- 

    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

Description:- This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database.  All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Only 14 attributes used:
      1. #3  (age)       
      2. #4  (sex)       
      3. #9  (cp)        
      4. #10 (trestbps)  
      5. #12 (chol)      
      6. #16 (fbs)       
      7. #19 (restecg)   
      8. #32 (thalach)   
      9. #38 (exang)     
      10. #40 (oldpeak)   
      11. #41 (slope)     
      12. #44 (ca)        
      13. #51 (thal)      
      14. #58 (num)       (the predicted attribute) - Target variable

# Auto MPG

    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg

Description:- This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.  The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original". "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993).
